# yomi-yomi

**Project Title:**
YomiYomi: A beginner-friendly Japanese reading app focused on short stories aligned with your WaniKani level. It will have English and Japanese titles, vocabulary lists, plot summaries, Japanese stories with hidden furigana, and artistic visuals to enhance the reading experience.

**Motivation:**
As a beginner developer and Japanese learner myself, I understand the challenges of getting started with reading practice. That's why I am creating this app to provide a structured and engaging way for you to embark on your Japanese reading journey. For me, this is a chance to improve my own Japanese and coding skills.

**Build Status:**
The build has only just started. Will be working initially on a simple style focused on the early levels of WaniKani. 

**Code:**
Starting the build in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**Features:**
<ol>
<li>Title in English and Japanese: Each story will be presented with its title written in both English and Japanese, allowing you to easily identify the content.</li>
<li>Vocabulary List: To support your learning, a comprehensive vocabulary list will be provided for each story. You'll find the Japanese words along with their English translations. The list will be conveniently hidden within a dropdown, allowing you to reveal it when needed.</li>
<li>Plot Summary: To give you a glimpse into the story, a plot summary will be provided in English. This summary will be hidden within a dropdown, ensuring that you can choose to read it or challenge yourself to dive into the story directly.</li>
<li>Japanese Story with Furigana: The story itself will be presented in Japanese, and to assist you in reading, furigana (phonetic guide) will be provided. This feature helps you navigate any unfamiliar kanji characters and build your reading confidence.</li>
<li>Artistic Visuals: To enhance your reading experience and bring the story to life, artistic images will be included. These visuals not only captivate your imagination but also help solidify your understanding of the Japanese narrative.</li>
